# InverseScatteringJB

A machine learning approach to solving the inverse scattering problem for 4th Year MSci Mathematics Project. Data is generated using the [Bempp-Cl](https://github.com/bempp/bempp-cl) Library. This repo contains the python file used for data generating along with notebooks containing a range of models being trained on a variety of machine learning tasks related to the inverse scattering problem.
